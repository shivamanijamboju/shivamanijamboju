## 🔧 Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### 1. Road Traffic Condition Monitoring using Deep Learning
- *Description:* Pioneered an intelligent, real-time road traffic monitoring system using deep learning and computer vision, achieving >90% accuracy in vehicle tracking, speed calculation, and traffic density assessment.The system includes anomaly detection for proactive responses and performance gains in predictive traffic forecasting models.
- Technologies Used:* Deep Learning (CNNs, YOLOv5), Computer Vision (OpenCV), TensorFlow, Keras, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, GitHub
 

### 2. Efficient Retrieval Over Documents Encrypted By Attributes in Cloud Computing
- *Description:* Engineered a novel framework for secure and efficient keyword-based retrieval over Attribute-Based Encrypted (ABE) documents in untrusted cloud environments. This involved developing a privacy-preserving searchable encryption scheme integrated with CP-ABE, ensuring fine-grained access control and data confidentiality, and optimizing index structures for significant performance improvements.
- *Technologies Used:* Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE), Data Analytics (TF-IDF), Python, Charm-Crypto, AWS S3 (conceptual), PyCharm, GitHub.
